  # Fix Document Storage and RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Disable RLS on documents table to allow unrestricted access
    - Create storage bucket configuration tracking
    - Add storage policies for authenticated users
    
  2. Security
    - Allows any authenticated user to access documents for development
